## Getting Started Tutorial

### First Time Setup

**Step 1: Open the Application**
1. Download `index.html` from this repository
2. Double-click the file to open it in your default browser
3. Or right-click ‚Üí "Open With" ‚Üí Choose your preferred browser

**Step 2: Understanding the Interface**

The application has three main areas:
- **Left Panel (Image List)**: Shows all your images with thumbnails, filenames, and controls
- **Right Panel (Text Editor)**: Where you write captions and reference your images
- **Header**: Contains the story code input, "Add images" button, and export controls

**Step 3: Add Your First Images**
1. Click the "Add images" button in the header
2. Select one or more image files from your computer
3. Or simply drag image files from your desktop/folder into the left panel
4. Watch as thumbnails appear automatically

**Step 4: Write Your First Caption**
1. Click in the text editor (right panel)
2. Type some text, like: "The Andromeda Galaxy shines brightly in this image."
3. Type `_01` anywhere in your text
4. Notice how `_01` turns blue - this means it references your first image!
5. Try clicking on the image thumbnail - it opens in a lightbox viewer

### How to Use CAPSTONE

#### Managing Images

**Adding Images**
- Click "Add images" button and select files
- Drag files from Finder/Explorer directly into the left panel
- Supports: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, and TIFF files

**Reordering Images**
1. Click and drag an image by its thumbnail or filename
2. As you drag, you'll see "INSERT HERE" indicators between images
3. Drop the image where you want it
4. All references in your text automatically update to match the new order!

**Deleting Images**
1. Click the √ó button on any image
2. If the image has children, you'll be asked to either delete all or promote children to parent level
3. Any references to deleted images turn red and show `!!` in the text

**Viewing Full-Size Images**
1. Click any thumbnail to open the lightbox viewer
2. Use arrow keys (‚Üê ‚Üí) or click arrows to navigate between images
3. Press ESC or click outside to close
4. Works perfectly with TIFF files for print workflows

#### Working with Story Codes

**What is a Story Code?**
A story code is an optional prefix added to all your image filenames when you export. For example, if your story code is "AstroMag2024", your images will be named:
- `AstroMag2024_01.jpg`
- `AstroMag2024_02.tif`
- `AstroMag2024_03.png`

**Setting a Story Code**
1. Click in the "Story Code" field at the top
2. Type your code (e.g., "NGC1977" or "AstroMag_Dec2024")
3. Press Enter to apply
4. All filenames in the left panel update immediately
5. To remove the story code, clear the field and press Enter

**When to Use Story Codes**
- Multi-story projects where you need unique identifiers
- Magazine workflows with specific naming conventions
- When you want meaningful filenames instead of just `_01`, `_02`

#### Using the Reference System

**Basic References**
- Type `_01` to reference the first image
- Type `_02` to reference the second image
- And so on...

**Reference Highlighting**
- **Blue**: Valid reference - image exists at that position
- **Red**: Broken reference - image missing or deleted

**Dynamic Updates**
When you reorder images, all references automatically update! For example:
1. You write: "The nebula in `_02` shows intricate detail"
2. You move that image to position 3
3. Your text automatically becomes: "The nebula in `_03` shows intricate detail"

**Best Practices**
- Write your captions first without worrying about exact positions
- Rearrange images later to match your narrative flow
- Use references early and often - they're validated in real-time
- Check for red highlights before exporting to catch missing images

#### Creating Parent-Child Image Groups

**Why Use Parent-Child Groups?**
Perfect for scenarios like:
- Main image + detail crop (`_01` and `_01detail`)
- Wide shot + closeup (`_02` and `_02closeup`)
- Original + annotated version (`_03` and `_03labeled`)

**How to Group Images**

**Method 1: Drag to Group**
1. Drag any image onto another image's thumbnail
2. You'll see a blue paperclip icon (üìé) appear
3. Drop to create the relationship
4. Enter a suffix when prompted (e.g., "detail", "closeup", "a", "b")
5. The child image appears indented under its parent

**Method 2: Understanding Visual Indicators**
- **Paperclip icon (üìé)**: Hovering over a thumbnail = drop here to group
- **"INSERT HERE" line**: Hovering between images = drop here to reorder
- Only parent images show the paperclip icon

**Working with Suffixes**
- Child images inherit their parent's position number
- Add custom suffixes to distinguish them
- Examples: `_01detail`, `_01a`, `_01_annotated`
- References work with suffixes: type `_01detail` in your text and it highlights in blue!

**Editing Suffixes**
1. Click the ‚úé (pencil) button on any image
2. Enter a new suffix
3. The system prevents duplicate filenames automatically

**Ungrouping (Promoting to Parent)**
1. Drag a child image to any "INSERT HERE" indicator
2. The image is automatically promoted to parent level
3. The suffix is cleared
4. The image gets its own position number

**Managing Parent Deletion**
When you delete a parent that has children, you'll be asked:
- **Delete all**: Removes parent and all children
- **Promote children**: Children become parents and lose their suffixes

#### Understanding Drag-and-Drop Visual Indicators

As you drag images, CAPSTONE shows clear visual feedback:

**Blue Border**: The thumbnail you're hovering over shows a blue highlight

**"INSERT HERE" Line**: A blue line appears between images where you can drop to reorder

**Paperclip Icon (üìé)**: Appears on parent images when you hover over their thumbnail - drop here to create a child relationship

**Indented Children**: Child images show with visual indentation and a connecting line to their parent

#### Export Workflow

**When to Export**
- When your captions are complete and all references are valid (all blue, no red)
- After final image ordering and grouping
- When you're ready to send files to designers or collaborators

**How to Export**
1. Click the "Export ZIP" button in the header
2. Choose where to save the ZIP file
3. The ZIP contains:
   - All your images with sequential filenames
   - A markdown file with your caption text
   - Original file formats preserved (TIFF stays TIFF, JPEG stays JPEG)

**Export Filename Format**

Without story code:
- `_01.jpg`
- `_02detail.tif`
- `_03.png`

With story code "NGC1977":
- `NGC1977_01.jpg`
- `NGC1977_02detail.tif`
- `NGC1977_03.png`

**Markdown File**
The exported markdown file contains your caption text with references intact, making it easy to:
- Copy into layout software
- Share with colleagues
- Archive for future reference

## Example Workflow

Let's walk through a complete real-world example: preparing images for a magazine article about the Orion Nebula.

**Step 1: Import Images**
You have 5 images:
- `IMG_8472.jpg` - Wide field view of Orion
- `DSC_1934.tif` - Detail of the Trapezium cluster (high-res TIFF)
- `IMG_8475.jpg` - Full nebula at different exposure
- `detail_crop.jpg` - Close-up of Trapezium (child of image 2)
- `annotated.jpg` - Labeled version showing key features

Drag all 5 into CAPSTONE.

**Step 2: Set Story Code**
1. Click in "Story Code" field
2. Type: `OrionNeb_Dec2024`
3. Press Enter

Your images are now named:
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_01` (wide field)
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_02` (Trapezium TIFF)
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_03` (full nebula)
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_04` (detail crop)
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_05` (annotated)

**Step 3: Organize Images**
You want the order: wide ‚Üí full ‚Üí Trapezium ‚Üí detail ‚Üí annotated

Drag the Trapezium TIFF to position 3, and the full nebula moves to position 2 automatically.

**Step 4: Create Parent-Child Relationships**
The detail crop should be a child of the Trapezium image:
1. Drag `detail_crop.jpg` onto the Trapezium thumbnail
2. Wait for the üìé icon
3. Drop it
4. Enter suffix: `detail`
5. Now it's named `OrionNeb_Dec2024_03detail`

**Step 5: Write Captions**
In the text editor:

```
The Orion Nebula complex spans several degrees in the winter sky. The wide-field view in _01
shows the entire region, with the main nebula prominently displayed in _02.

The Trapezium cluster at the heart of the nebula is shown in _03, with a detailed close-up
in _03detail revealing the individual stars of the multiple star system.

Key features are labeled in _04 for reference.
```

Notice:
- `_01`, `_02`, `_03`, `_03detail`, `_04` all highlight in blue
- If you reorder images, these references automatically update!

**Step 6: Final Check**
- All references are blue ‚úì
- Image order matches narrative flow ‚úì
- Story code is set ‚úì
- Project auto-saved ‚úì

**Step 7: Export**
1. Click "Export ZIP"
2. Save as `Orion_Article_Final.zip`

**Result**: ZIP file contains:
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_01.jpg`
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_02.jpg`
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_03.tif` (TIFF format preserved!)
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_03detail.jpg`
- `OrionNeb_Dec2024_04.jpg`
- `captions.md` (markdown file with your text)

## Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Cmd/Ctrl + S**: Manual save (shows "Project saved." confirmation)
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between images in lightbox viewer
- **ESC**: Close lightbox viewer

### Efficient Workflows

**For Multi-Image Stories**
1. Import all images at once (select multiple files)
2. Set story code immediately before organizing
3. Rough out captions with references before finalizing order
4. Use parent-child for alternate versions/crops of same subject

**For Print Workflows**
- Keep TIFF files for final print versions
- Use JPEG for web/preview versions as children (e.g., `_01.tif` parent, `_01web.jpg` child)
- TIFF thumbnails are generated automatically

**For Collaboration**
- Export ZIP files to share complete packages
- Include the markdown file for caption text
- Recipients can re-import into CAPSTONE if needed

### Common Patterns

**Detail Shots**
- Main image: `_01`
- Detail: `_01detail` or `_01closeup`
- Another detail: `_01detail2`

**Multiple Views**
- Wide: `_02`
- Medium: `_02med`
- Close: `_02close`

**Before/After or Comparison**
- Before: `_03`
- After: `_03after`
- Or use: `_03a` and `_03b`

### Troubleshooting

**Red References After Deletion**
If you delete an image and see red `!!` markers:
1. Click the red reference in your text
2. Either rewrite the sentence or replace with the correct new reference number
3. Red highlights disappear once you fix or remove the reference

**Lost Work?**
- CAPSTONE auto-saves after every change
- Simply reopen `index.html` - your last project loads automatically
- Use Cmd/Ctrl+S frequently for peace of mind

**Drag Not Working?**
- Make sure you're dragging from the thumbnail or filename area
- Look for visual indicators (blue highlights, INSERT HERE line, paperclip icon)
- For grouping: hover over thumbnail until you see üìé before dropping

**Export Missing Images?**
- Check that all images show thumbnails (not gray placeholders)
- TIFF files may take a moment to process - wait for thumbnails to appear
- Try manual save (Cmd/Ctrl+S) before exporting
